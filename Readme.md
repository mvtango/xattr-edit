# xattr-edit.py

This utility makes exporting, importing and bulk editing of extended file system attributes in the "user." namespace easy, either with your favourite editor or by tools that can generate or manipulate text files. 

It needs Python 3.6 and these fine libraries, mentioned in `requirements.txt`:

```
archieml==0.3.2
cffi==1.10.0
fire==0.1.2
pycparser==2.18
six==1.10.0
xattr==0.9.2
Jinja2==2.9.6
```



## Extended Attributes

These attributes are supported by a lot of Mac and Unix filesystems, and if you take precautions, they can survive rsync, cp and tar. For details, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes on Wikipedia.

The switch --attrcopy keeps a text file with the attribute values around. If you place it into the right directory, it can be picked up by file mode transfers that ignore extended attributes, and attributes can easily be restored using this utility. 

This utility only works on the "user." namespace of the attributes

## Usage and Help from `xattr-edit.py -- --help`

```

Interactive mode:

      xattr-edit.py [PATH/GLOB PATTERN]

      (edits extended attributes in place)

      xattr-edit.py --attrcopy=attributes.txt [PATH/GLOB PATTERN]

      (This version keeps a copy of the extended attributes  in a text file,
      so they can survive Dropbox, S3 or other file transfers. You can
      then read them at the other end of the file transfer using the
      --fromfile parameter, see below.)

Dump extended attributes to file (to edit) :

      xattr-edit.py [PATH/GLOB PATTERN] >attrlist.txt

       - or (filenames from stdin) -

      find . -name '*png' | xattr-edit.py >attrlist.txt


      (then edit attrlist.txt, and then)

      xattr-edit.py --fromfile=attrlist.txt

      --fromfile=- will read from <stdin>.




[GLOB PATTERN] supports patters from python pathlib, like './**/*gz' for
"all .gz files in all directories below this one".

--delete=True delete extended attributes that are listed in the --edit
  parameter, but are not present in the input data.
  Default is False (keep those attributes).

--edit='("date","author")' will limit editing to the listed attributes,
  inserting empty values if they are not present.
  Please use a python tuple literal like the one above, and --edit='()'
  to edit all attributes.
  The default list is defined in the config module whithin this module.

--loglevel=DEBUG|INFO|ERROR. Default is "INFO"

Usage:       xattr-edit.py [PATH] [ATTRCOPY] [EDIT] [DELETE] [LOGLEVEL] [FROMFILE]
             xattr-edit.py [--path PATH] [--attrcopy ATTRCOPY] [--edit EDIT] [--delete DELETE] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL] [--fromfile FROMFILE]
```



## Thanks to

  - [ArchieML](http://archieml.org/) ;-) - the human friendly intermediate format used to edit the attributes

  - [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - makes a command line utility out of every python object


## Further Ideas


  - Read/write extended attributes to / from S3 object metadata 
    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#object-metadata

  - Keep persistent extended attribute database in SQLITE / JSON file
